In this post, we'll guide you through building a simple large language model using Python. Specifically, we will focus on GPT-2 by OpenAI and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) by Google.

To start, ensure that you have the necessary Python libraries installed. If you don't, you can install them using the following commands:

________________________________

pip install torch

pip install transformers

________________________________

We will use the `transformers` library provided by Hugging Face, which hosts thousands of pretrained models for various natural language processing tasks.



GPT-2

Let's first start with GPT-2:

________________________________

from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer

# Initialize the GPT2 tokenizer and model

tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")

model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained("gpt2")

# Define a text prompt

text = "Our Test"

# Encode the input text to tensor

indexed_tokens = tokenizer.encode(text, return_tensors='pt')

# Generate text until the output length (which includes the context length) reaches 50

output_text = model.generate(indexed_tokens, max_length=50, num_beams=5, no_repeat_ngram_size=2, early_stopping=True)

# Decode the output text

output_text_decoded = tokenizer.decode(output_text[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

print(output_text_decoded)

________________________________

This script loads the pretrained GPT-2 model, tokenizes an input prompt, and generates a continuation of the input text.



BERT

Now, let's see how we can leverage BERT for a classification task:

________________________________

from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification

import torch

# Initialize the BERT tokenizer and model

tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")

model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")

# Define a text prompt

text = "The movie was fantastic!"

# Encode the input text to tensor

inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt")

# Classify the text

outputs = model(inputs)

# The model returns the classification scores which are usually passed to a softmax function

# Here, we will just print the raw scores

print(outputs.logits)

________________________________

This script uses a pretrained BERT model to classify the sentiment of a movie review. You can replace "bert-base-uncased" with the model of your choice from the list of pretrained models available on the Hugging Face model hub.

Note: Building large language models from scratch requires vast amounts of data and computational resources. That's why we're using pre-trained models here. However, you can fine-tune these models on your specific text corpus using the `transformers` library's training methods. Finally, be aware that the computational resources required for GPT-3 and especially GPT-4 are significantly greater than for GPT-2.

In conclusion, we've shown how to implement simple tasks with large language models in Python. These models offer wide-ranging capabilities, but always ensure their responsible use to avoid potential misuse in generating misleading information, spam, or offensive content.
